# VocabularyApp
An application written in Java and ran in Netbeans, created to help optimize the process of learning vocabulary. Features of the application include: adding new English words, getting a suggested Vietnamese meaning of the entered English word by an Eng-Viet translation API, studying flashcards created in two language modes Eng-Viet or Viet-Eng and testing your progress by taking quizzes in both languages mode.
